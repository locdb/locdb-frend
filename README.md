This repository provides a guided user interface for extrapolation of new data for the [Linked Open Citation Data Base](https://github.com/locdb/loc-db).
More specific, two views are provided:

- `FLUP` - An assistant for file upload of reference lists.
- `Extrapolite` - An assistant for linking bibliographic resources from these reference lists.

## Branch policy

The `master` branch contains the most recent stable version of the front-end.
The `dev` branch contains nightly builds.


## Basic setup

1. Clone this repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `ng serve` and access the prototype via `localhost:4200`
