# Frontend REST API Needs

## Assumptions and Terminology

- I call the unique identifier (`ppn_pagenr` or something else) for some `TODO item`:  `id`.

- Some `TODO` item has several `bibliographicEntries` (`BE`s) and one image snippet for each `BE`.

- I assume  that we use also unique identifiers for the `BE`, in URIs `<BE>` refers to the id of the `BE`.

- Suggested URIs may be changed as you like. (But some kind of mnemonics are helpful to reach potential API users)

## Desired API functionality

- `GET /todos/` $\rightarrow$ all `TODO` items (i.e. scans) in the system by their `id`s

- `GET /snippets/<id>` $\rightarrow$ all `BE.id` s each with one image snippets, for some `TODO` item `id` [^1]

- `GET /suggest/<BE>` $\rightarrow$ all locdb suggestions for some specific `BE` 

- `PUT /cite/<BE>/<BR>` $\leftarrow$ update locdb record (`BR.cites`) with a *single* new citation (`BE` $\to$ `BR`)

## Case: Bib Resource not in LOCDB yet 

- `GET /harvest/<BE>` $\rightarrow$ all suggestions(list of `BR`s) from *external sources* for `BE`

- `POST /link/<BR>/<external BR>` $\leftarrow$ user marks external source to be relevant

- `GET /bibliographicResource/<id>` should then include: per-field suggestions obtained by OCR engine (..and merged with information from external sources?).





[^1]: Seperate image snippets are way more convenient to deal with and could be implemented until April.
      I will most likely not be able to set up some interactive pdf/image viewer that can draw bounding boxes and make them clickable until then.
